# Deploy-Python-Microservices-with-Kubernetes-and-Istio

## 1. Prerequisites ##
Kubernetes Cluster: Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using GKE, EKS, AKS, or Minikube for local testing).

Istio: Install Istio in your Kubernetes cluster.

Docker Hub or Container Registry: A place to store your Docker images.

GitHub Repository: A repository containing your Python microservices code.

kubectl: Configured to access your Kubernetes cluster.

Helm (optional): For managing Istio or other Kubernetes deployments.

2. Structure of the Application
Assume you have three Python microservices:

Service A: Exposes an API.

Service B: Exposes another API.

Service C: A backend service that interacts with Service A and B.

Each service has its own:

Dockerfile

Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files

GitHub Actions workflow file
